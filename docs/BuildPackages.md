#### CMake
[CMake](https://cmake.org) is the core infrastructure used to configure builds of 
Swift and its companion projects; at least version 3.4.3 is required. 

On macOS, you can download the [CMake Binary Distribution](https://cmake.org/download),
bundled as an application, copy it to `/Applications`, and add the embedded
command line tools to your `PATH`:

    export PATH=/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin:$PATH
    
On Linux, if you have not already installed Swift's [development
dependencies](#linux-dependencies), you can download and install the CMake
package separately using the following command:

    sudo apt-get install cmake
    

#### Ninja
[Ninja](https://ninja-build.org) is the current recommended build system
for building Swift and is the default configuration generated by CMake. [Pre-built
packages](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/Pre-built-Ninja-packages)
are available for macOS and Linux distributions. You can also clone Ninja
next to the other projects and it will be bootstrapped automatically:

**Via HTTPS**

    git clone https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja.git && cd ninja
    git checkout release
    cat README

**Via SSH**

    git clone git@github.com:ninja-build/ninja.git && cd ninja
    git checkout release
    cat README
